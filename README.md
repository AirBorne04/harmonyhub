# harmonyhub
`harmonyhub` is a Node.JS library which wants to consolidate functions around interaction with a Logitech Harmony Hub from various different libraries from the community (the original authors and repos can be found in the Readme of each of the contained packages).
The library contains the following packages:

Package | Status
------------ | -------------
[client](/packages/client) (interacting with the hub) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40harmonyhub/client.svg)](https://npmjs.com/%40harmonyhub%2Fclient) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/%40harmonyhub%2Fclient.svg)](https://npmjs.com/%40harmonyhub%2Fclient)
[discover](/packages/discover) (find a hub in your network) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40harmonyhub/discover.svg)](https://npmjs.com/%40harmonyhub%2Fdiscover) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/%40harmonyhub%2Fdiscover.svg)](https://npmjs.com/%40harmonyhub%2Fdiscover)

I recommend to use typescript since this helps to use this code without digging to much into the documentation in code :)

## Installation
```bash
npm install @harmonyhub/*
```
Where * is your package name.
