##Â Usage
```javascript
var harmony = require('@harmonyhub/client');

harmony('192.168.1.200')
  .then(function(harmonyClient) {
    harmonyClient.isOff()
      .then(function(off) {
        if(off) {
          console.log('Currently off. Turning TV on.');

          harmonyClient.getActivities()
            .then(function(activities) {
              activities.some(function(activity) {
                if(activity.label === 'Watch TV') {
                  var id = activity.id
                  harmonyClient.startActivity(id)
                  harmonyClient.end()
                  return true
                }
                return false
              })
            });
        } else {
          console.log('Currently on. Turning TV off');
          harmonyClient.turnOff();
          harmonyClient.end();
        }
      })
  });
```

This example connects to a Harmony hub available on the IP `192.168.1.200`. As soon as the the connection is established, `isOff()` checks if the equipment is turned off. If off, the activity with the name `Watch TV` is started. If on, all devices are turned off.
